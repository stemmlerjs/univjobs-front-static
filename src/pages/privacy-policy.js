<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

      <p>
        Welcome to UnivJobs, operated by DCommons, Inc. (“UnivJobs” and
        sometimes referred to as “our”) and located at Mississauga, Ontario. This Privacy Policy addresses
        UnivJobs' practices regarding information collected from users and
        visitors of our Services and only addresses information collected
        directly through or from our Services – it does not address or govern
        any information-gathering, use, or dissemination practices related to
        information collected from the visitor (sometimes referred to as a
        “visitor,” "you" or "your") other than directly through or from our
        Services, such as from telephone, facsimile, postal mail, personal
        delivery, or other or additional offline means or media.
      </p>

      <p>
        This Privacy Policy is incorporated into UnivJobs Terms and Conditions
        by reference, as if set forth fully therein, which must be reviewed and
        accepted by you. Our Services are not intended for children under the

        Collection of Personal Information from Services Visitors. In addition
        to other collection methods specifically set forth herein, UnivJobs may
        collect: (a) the email addresses of users that communicate with UnivJobs
        via email; and (b) information knowingly provided by the user through
        our Services in informational sections, including any contact,
        registration, or application forms. UnivJobs may also use Internet
        cookies and other identifiers or methods of web analysis to gather,
        store, and track certain information related to your visit to and
        activity on our Services. If you are uncomfortable with the idea of your
        information being used in this way, most computer systems and web
        browsers offer privacy settings and options, such as disabling cookies
        or opting for “Do Not Track” features. UnivJobs does not override these
        settings or options, and encourages you to use them to enhance your
        choices and personalize your experiences. However, in order to access
        certain content, features, services, products or benefits on our
        Services, you may be required to provide UnivJobs with certain
        information, including some types of personally identifying information
        such as your email, educational institution, business affiliation,
        address, and phone number. If you do not wish to provide such
        information through our Services or if you opt to utilize the
        aforementioned privacy features of your computer system or web browser,
        you may not be able to obtain certain content, features, services,
        products or benefits of our Services.
      </p>

      <p>
        Use of Personal Information Collected. Personal information collected by
        UnivJobs may be used by UnivJobs for limited purposes, including
        recordkeeping, editorial and feedback purposes, content improvement, or
        to customize the content and layout of our Services. Personally
        identifying information, such as names, postal and email addresses,
        phone numbers, and other personal information voluntarily provided to
        UnivJobs may be added to UnivJobs' databses and used for future contact
        regarding updates to our Services or new services provided by UnivJobs.
        From time to time, UnivJobs may need to contact you regarding
        information you submitted to UnivJobs. You agree that UnivJobs may use
        your personal information for such contact with you. UnivJobs may also
        desire to contact you for market research purposes or to provide you
        with marketing information that UnivJobs believes would be of particular
        interest. You will have the option of not being contacted by UnivJobs
        and opting-out of such contacts by selecting the opt-out option in your

      <p>
        Disclosure of Personal Information to Third parties. Except as
        specifically set forth herein, any personally-identifying information
        that you provide to UnivJobs through our Services will not be disclosed
        to third parties not affiliated with UnivJobs. Notwithstanding the
        foregoing, any information you submit to UnivJobs, including any
        personally-identifying information you include in your personal profile
        with our Services, may be viewed and accessed by others, and may be
        indexed and displayed through our Services’s internal search engines and
        other publicly accessible search engines. Your personally-identifying
        information may also be disclosed to third parties in order to verify
        that information, including by contacting your educational institution
        or business affiliation, and in order to provide you with the services
        requested through our Services, including to third party payment
        processors for the processing of payments. Personally-identifying
        information may be used by UnivJobs approved third party vendors to
        assist UnivJobs in providing, improving, analyzing, and securing our
        Services. Identifying and non-identifying user information and data may
        also be disclosed or distributed to a third party with which UnivJobs
        enters or reasonably may enter into a corporate transaction, such as,
        for example, a merger, consolidation, acquisition, or asset purchase, or
        to a third party pursuant to a subpoena, court order, or other form of
        legal process, in response to a request by or on behalf of any local,
        state, federal, or other government agency, department, or body, whether
        or not pursuant to a subpoena, court order, or other form of legal
        process, or if determined by UnivJobs in its sole judgment that such
        disclosure or distribution is appropriate to protect the life, health,
        or property of UnivJobs or any other person or entity. In addition,
        identifying and non-identifying user information and data may be
        provided to third parties that contract with UnivJobs to provide
        products, information, or other services that UnivJobs believes that
        visitors to our Services may be interested in obtaining. While UnivJobs
        may undertake efforts to see that any third party to which UnivJobs
        discloses personally-identifying information is under an obligation to
        use the personal information solely for the purposes for which the
        information was disclosed, such third parties are independent third
        parties over which UnivJobs exercises no control. UnivJobs is not
        responsible for, and will not be liable for, the conduct, actions,
        omissions, or information handling or dissemination practices of third
        parties.
