      <p>
        Welcome to Univjobs, operated by DCommons, Inc. (“Univjobs” and
        sometimes referred to as “our”) and located at Mississauaga, Ontario.
        Thank you for using or visiting our products and services (“Services”).
        Our Services are a platform through which current and former students at
        particular educational institutions seeking employment opportunities or
        contracting opportunities (each, a “Student”) can find and connect with
        providers of such employment or contracting opportunities (each, a
        “Business”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Univjobs does not take part in, nor is DCommons, Inc in any way
        responsible for, any interactions between Students and Businesses,
        except to the extent necessary to maintain our Services. Any interaction
        between you and any other individual or entity through our Services or
        arising out of your use of our Services, including any interactions
        between Businesses and Students, is solely between you and that other
        individual or entity. Univjobs expressly disclaims any responsibility
        for any interactions between Students and Businesses. For avoidance of
        doubt, Univjobs disclaims any responsibility for any employment or
        contracting opportunities, employment or contracting services, or any
        other services or products acquired or made available through our
        Services, even if Univjobs investigates or attempts to verify any
        information in connection therewith. You agree that you must evaluate
        and bear all risks associated with the use of our Services, including
        the Services Materials and the User Content, and that you may not rely
        on the Services Materials or User Content.

      <p>
        The following terms and conditions (“Terms”) govern your use of our
        Services. These Terms are deemed to include all other operating rules,

          <b>Registration.</b> In order to access certain content, services,
          products or benefits on our Services, you will be asked to register
          and create an account. By registering an account on our Services, you
          represent that you are 18 years of age or older. Depending on your
          intended uses of our Services, you may be asked to designate your
          account as either a Student Account (i.e., for a Student) or a
          Business Account (i.e., for a Business). Your obligations and rights
          under these Terms may vary depending on whether you registered as a
          Student or a Business. Also as part of the registration process, you
          may be asked to select a username and password, and may be required to
          provide Univjobs with certain information about yourself, including
          some types of personally identifying information such as your email
          and postal addresses, your telephone number and your employer or
          educational institution. You agree that the information that you
          provide to us on registration and at all other times will be true,
          accurate, current and complete. You also agree that you will ensure
          that this information is kept accurate and up to date at all times.
          Any information that you provide to Univjobs through our Services or
          email is subject to Univjobs' Privacy Policy, which is hereby
          incorporated into these Terms by reference as if set forth fully
          herein.
          <p>
            As part of the registration process, you will be asked to select a
            user name and password. Only you are permitted to access our
            Services, the Services Materials, and the User Content through your
            account. Without limiting the foregoing, you are fully responsible
            for your account, including use of the account by any third party,
            and maintaining the confidentiality of your password. You may
            suspend your account at any time by suspending the account within
            your profile or by emailing{' '}
            <a href="mailto:contact@univjobs.ca?" target="_top">
              contact@univjobs.ca
            </a>
          </p>
          <p>
            By registering, you are subscribing to transactional notification
            emails and/or text messages related to the Services (including
            notifications that will inform you when a job that matches your
            profile is posted). You can unsubscribe or manage your notification
            frequency settings at any time by logging into your account and
            changing your notification settings or by using any of the other
            methods described in the Privacy Policy.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Verification.</b> By registering with our Services, you hereby
          authorize Univjobs to verify any representations and warranties you
          make either pursuant to these Terms or within any materials submitted
          during the registration process, including conducting background
          checks, contacting any provided references, and reviewing public
          records. You acknowledge that while Univjobs reserves the right to
          verify these representations and warranties, Univjobs is not obligated
          to do so, and may choose not to do so, at Univjobs' sole discretion.
        </li>

        <li>
          <p />
          <b>Listing Employment or Contracting Opportunities</b> Upon
          registration, a Business may submit, through our Services, a
          notification to Students of a potential employment or contracting
          opportunity (a “Job Posting”). A Job Posting may only notify Students
          of a single employment or contracting opportunity, and must include,
          at a minimum, the following information: start date, position title
          and job description. Upon submission of a Job Posting, the submitting
          Business may fix typographical errors within the Job Posting, but may
          not make any substantial changes to the Job Posting. Univjobs may also
          fix typographical errors within the Job Posting, but is not obligated
          to.
          <p>
            You agree not to use our Services to promote or further the
            commercial activities, including by submitting a Job Posting in
            connection with those activities, of any of the businesses,
            activities, or practices set forth in Univjobs list of Prohibited
            Business, as incorporated into these Terms by reference as if set
            forth fully herein. For avoidance of doubt, each Job Posting must
            comply with all restrictions hereunder, including those governing
            the submission of User Content and general use of our Services.
            Univjobs may, but is not obligated to, make an independent
            investigation of the Job Posting to ensure full compliance with
            these Terms. If Univjobs determines, in its sole discretion, that
            any representation or warranty made by you pursuant to these Terms
            is in any way false, incomplete, or inaccurate, Univjobs may, at any
            time, reject, remove, or suspend or delay the posting of your Job
            Posting, in whole or in part. Univjobs may, but is not obligated to,
            provide you with an explanation for the rejection or removal of any
            of your Job Postings from our Services.
          </p>
          <p>
            All jobs posted on Univjobs will be automatically transferred into a
            publicly-viewable job listing page. These pages are indexed to
            various third parties, and are not taken down after being filled;
            however, the job page will not accept applicants once a listing is
            closed (and the page will act as informational only, with links
            bringing a user back to the Univjobs default homepages.)
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p />
          <b>Privacy.</b> It is important that you read and understand the
          Privacy Policy, especially because the nature of the Services
          necessarily involve the collection and use of personally identifiable
          information and other personal data (‘Personal Data’). The most
          current Privacy Policy will apply to any and all use of the Services.
          Univjobs will not intentionally edit, modify, delete or disclose the
          contents of your Personal Data in connection with the Services except
          (a) as reasonably necessary for Univjobs (or its service providers) to
          provide the Services, including processing and responding to your
          inputs, (b) to communicate with you, (c) as otherwise permitted under
          the Privacy Policy or elsewhere in these Terms, (d) when Univjobs
          reasonably believes that such action is necessary to conform or comply
          with any legal, regulatory, law enforcement or similar requirement or
          investigation, to protect or defend the rights or property of Univjobs
          or any third party or to enforce the Terms or (e) as otherwise
          authorized by you.
        </li>

        <li>
          <p />
          <b>Payment.</b> Some of our Services, including the opportunity for a
          Business to post an employment opportunity, will be available for
          purchase. You are responsible for all charges incurred under your
          account, whether made by you or another person using your account. If
          for any reason Univjobs does not receive payment for a purchase,
          Univjobs may exercise its rights in law and equity, including (a)
          immediately suspending or terminating your account; (b) seeking
          collection of the outstanding amount owed; and/or (c) seeking legal
          action against you for the breach of these Terms. You are also
          responsible for paying any governmental taxes imposed in connection
          with use or purchase of any of our Services, including sales, use, and
          excise taxes (excluding only taxes on Univjobs net income). To the
          extent that Univjobs is obligated to collect such taxes, the
          applicable tax will be added to your billing account. All sales are
          final. Univjobs is not responsible for any costs or expenses in
          connection with any interactions between Students and Businesses.
        </li>

            property rights in our Services or the content you access. You may
