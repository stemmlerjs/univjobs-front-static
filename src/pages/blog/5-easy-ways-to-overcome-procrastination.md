With a new year upon us, that wonderful time where our willpower dies and we give up on all of those resolutions we made. 
If you’re human like us, procrastination might be the biggest obstacle holding you back from doing your best, but it’s never too late to turn over a new leaf and change your bad habits for good. Whether you vowed to get fit, hand in your essays on time or call your mom more often, here are our tips to stop procrastinating and get it done!  

# 1. Break down your goals

Looking at a task as a whole can be overwhelming, and many of us choose to just cope with this by avoiding until we get dangerously close to the deadline. This can cause way more stress in the long run.

Avoid this cycle by breaking the task down into smaller tasks, and scheduling time to get each one done, as opposed to all at once. 

For example, if you have a paper due, break it down to a writing few paragraphs at a time. It will be far more productive to spend 30 minutes writing per day as opposed to eight hours all at once. 

# 2. Reward yourself

Many of us procrastinate because we dread the displeasure that the task will bring us. Condition yourself to associate pleasure with work by giving yourself a reward every time you get a task done. What motivates you and makes you happy is an individual thing, but our favorite ideas are watching 20 minutes of YouTube, chocolate chip cookies, or taking a break to spend time with friends. 

# 3. Rethink distractions

Technology is great, but sometimes if feels like your enemy when you’re trying to get things done. As soon as you put your phone down to get to the gym, there’s your computer taunting you with the siren call of Netflix. 

You have to be the judge of whether you need to avoid these distractions completely and isolate yourself until your work is done, or you can try using them as a reward like in our former point. 

Apps like [Helium](https://univjobs.ca/blog/11-must-have-apps-for-students/) are great for this because give you a small window to indulge in distraction while getting work done. 


# 4. Don’t overthink it

Shift your focus from the drudgery of getting down to business and picture the good feelings you’ll have once the task is done instead. 
Envision yourself finishing your work. Keep a positive attitude, even if it feels forced. Building positive thought patterns and associations takes time and work, but just like any skill it gets strengthened over time.

# 5. Avoid perfection

Have you ever decided not to pursue something if it’s not going to be exactly the way you want it? Striving for the best is a positive quality, but not when it’s holding you back from getting anything done.   
As cheesy as it sounds, just do your best and you will achieve your goals. At the end of the day just remember that “Pobody’s Nerfect”.

After trying out these tips, you should be better prepared to accomplish anything you set your mind to. Are you looking to put these skills to the test?
