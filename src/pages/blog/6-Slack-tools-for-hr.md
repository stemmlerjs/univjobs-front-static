Slack has been around 2013 and it has taken the world of work by storm by hyper connecting teams through it’s powerful messaging platform. There are over [8 million daily active users, 9 million weekly active users, 3 million paid accounts](https://expandedramblings.com/index.php/slack-statistics/). From startups to big establish companies like Scotia Digital Factory(I worked their briefly), people rave about Slack and the numbers show it. This is why I believe that you as an HR member, Slack is the perfect tool to improve engagement, manage feedback loops, recognize wins(big or small) and improve team culture because people are already using it daily. The following tools I’m sharing are the ones curated to help you supercharge your productivity.

Icebreaker is a tool that lets you get to know your team by asking icebreaker questions through Slack. Each week a random set of team members are picked and are asked a few fun short questions about themselves. The answers are posted in a public channel of your choice along with names, departments and roles. It’s a quick fun way to get to know people you work with each week.

The fond app will track the recognitions and send a personal message to the mentioned team member. Public recognitions are also enabled to give team wide recognitions. This tool promotes positive social relationships in the workplace by encouraging teams to recognize each team members value.
