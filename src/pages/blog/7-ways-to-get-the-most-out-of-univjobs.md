# 1.) Have a nice logo for brand awareness

Does your company have a logo? Make sure you upload it in your profile! We've discovered that companies with logos tend to have better performing job postings than those who don't, because it provides an image of trust.

When you're uploading your logo, make sure that it's not pixelated. We recommend a minimum size of at least 200 x 200 pixels. 

# 2.) Spend time crafting a good job description

Hiring great talent starts with attracting the right talent. Having an effective, engaging and inclusive job description is key. Invest some time in crafting the right job description to bring a wide range of highly talented candidates into your pipeline — and ensure you’re not turning off talent before they even apply.

# 3.) Provide an accurate picture of job day-to-day

You can improve the retention of potential employees by providing an accurate and honest picture of the job your organization is hiring for. This allows applicants to make an informed decision about whether they wish to accept the job offer.

# 4.) Spend 3 minutes a day inviting 5 people

Don't "post and pray". Univjobs' _invite_ feature allows you to invite students that you're interested in to apply to your posting. 

Being personally invited to apply to a posting is a really effective approach in opening up a dialogue with a potential candidate. After the student applies, you have the ability to reach out to them using our **Message Center**. 

Spend about 3 minutes a day to invite candidates that fit your criteria.

# 5.) Ask good questions ahead of time

Univjobs allows you to ask students questions ahead of time before they apply to your posting. You can use this to screen potential candidate and save time. 

On the second page of posting a new job, use the text fields to ask candidates if they have certifications, practical experience with a language or framework, or just about anything that you think would be useful to filter out applicants.

# 6.) Use the compensation section on the job listing to attract students

Aside from monetary compensation, are there any other benefits you can offer to students to appear more attractive? Do you offer free lunch? Paid training? 

# 7.) Share your job links on social media

We live in a digital age, most of Gen Z and Millenials surf the web. Take advantage of this by sharing your links to FB, Twitter, or Instagram.
