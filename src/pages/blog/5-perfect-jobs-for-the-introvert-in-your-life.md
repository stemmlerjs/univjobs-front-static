Before we get to the best careers for introverts, let's take a look into what an introvert actually is.

# What Is An Introvert ?

The definition of an introvert according to dictionary.com is someone who prefers calm, minimally stimulating environments. Introverts tend to feel drained after socializing.

# What Does It Mean For Your Career

Well often times if you're an introvert, you may need to be selective with the opportunities you take and luckily we have talked to our "panel" of introverts and these are the top jobs they see themselves doing:

## Freelance Web Developer

You’re multilingual. You speak and write in your native tongue, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby, and Python. Basically, you’re a genius. And in this tech filled world, your skill is in high demand, my friend. Call the shots, ditch the office setting, and fly solo. That way you can write all the poetic code and develop the next biggest thing!

## Graphic Designer

Your favourite colour is a hex code and your portfolio is filled with your living room famous logos. Whether you are a classically trained Adobe aficionado or you're trying to break into the art world. This is perfect for the artsy/design minded students.

## Film/Video Editor

Just you, the footage, and your laptop. What can get any better than this? There are many parts to bringing a film/video to life. Editors get to be a part of the action behind the scenes right in their home office. As long as you master some editing software and nurture your gift, you’ll be ready to roll.

## Blogger

You’re the life of the party — online. If you have a way with words and consider yourself an expert in a few areas, then let your personality shine online as a blogger/content writer. This fun and easy position allows you to work from home & potentially make money doing it. Can you say "Dream Job".

## Social Media Manager

Oh, just your average introvert talking with hundreds of people. NBD. Social Media Managers connect with the online communities of brands and organizations. It allows for you to socialize without all the fuss of actually socializing. Bonus this job is always in demand with companies looking to pay a lot of money to get a good SMM (the abbreviation for social media manager) .
