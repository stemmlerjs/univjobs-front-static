But has anyone ever explored the idea that hiring students can be beneficial for the employers as well ? With that being said, here are the 15 benefits of hiring students for summer jobs.

# 1. Gain insight into potential target market

Large corporations pay billions of dollars targeting millenials and Gen Z (persons born between the years of 1995–2014) and often times small to medium business may think they cannot compete. Well, often times the answer may be right in front of you and that could be as easy as Hiring Students. The wealth of knowledge and data you gain from first hand experience could be the gold mine no business has discovered because of this "purple squirrel" approach to business.

# 2. Hiring Local Looks Good For Business

The idea of hiring local adds to the narrative of businesses akin to an athlete being drafted by their hometown team (think Lebron James being drafted by his hometown Cleveland Cavaliers). Picture this " Tanya grew up going to Steve's Candy Store. As soon as she was able to, she applied and got a job at the candy store, and so the narrative of Steve's Candy Store being a place that hires trusted local talent begins. The value of having someone who lives within the area, and who has been invested in the brand/business is what adds an additional value prop to sed brand/business.

# 3. Eager Students = Innovative Solutions

When hiring someone, employers may want to factor in the soft skills in combination with the technical skills. A student either in school or fresh out of school brings something that someone 10 years into the industry doesn’t have, a fresh mindset (not bogged down by workplace strife or negative client experiences) and an eagerness to make an impact within their chosen position.

# 4. Diamonds Are Made, They Don’t Just Appear

When looking at a potential hiring, what I have noticed is that most employers are unrealistically looking for students with a minimum of 2-5 years’ experience. The benefit of hiring a student is that often times the student is looking to grow and be able to hone/become better in their position. The better the training and work environment, the more growth results from the experience and thus a diamond employee is created.

# 5. The Start Of A Relationship

The benefit of hiring a student is largely the fact that much like dating it allows an employer to build a relationship with a potential employee. Even if the student is still enrolled in college/university odds are during the summer or when that student graduates, that student is guaranteed to go back to you and you as the employer should be more than happy to have them because much like a relationship if you put in the time, then just breaking it off without any real reason makes no sense (sorry did not mean to go all Dr. Phil there).

# 6. Better Skilled Workers

There are studies which show that 80% of jobs by 2030 have not been invented yet. So, if you as an employer are looking to set yourself apart from the rest of the pack, it might be wise to be thinking proactively about student hires, as they may have skills that you may not have in this ever-changing technology filled environment, also (refer to my previous points about the advantages of hiring students for summer jobs).

# 7. Investing Early

If businesses want to remain competitive the best thing to do is hire students for the summer because it is better to get a good worker at an affordable scale than to have to pay that same person a premium when they have properly honed in their talent.

Think of this as getting a good stock tip when the company is still trading at 2.00 a stock, when you know the next day that same stock will shoot up to some insane value the next day

# 8. Long Term Staying Power

Like many points we’ve already hit on, this is something every employer considers when looking at a potential employer: Are they going to stick around? Well, good news for you employers, students look for long term job security so odds are even if a student only spends their summer at the same job the return rate will be higher when that student graduates if the succession rate is higher since that student has already ingratiated themselves through the system.

# 10. They’re Quick Learners

Students spend their time needing to learn and understand the material in a short amount of time. Adding a job that requires the student to learn concepts is no big deal.

# 11. Provides Opportunities For Government Funding

The government offers opportunities to get funding just for hiring students. The one opportunity that is relevant to this particular article is the Canada Summer Jobs , which is an initiative of the Summer Work Experience program. It provides wage subsidies to employers to create employment for secondary and post-secondary students.

# 12. Technology Is Like Water To Them

Social media, computer programs, iPads – these are a piece of cake for students. And, although you’re a business professional, you can always use some help. Especially, with new software coming out each day it saves you time since a student is already familiar with the emerging technology.

# 13. Gain Brand Advocates

Hiring an intern helps spread the word about your company—whether you mean to or not. If you’re an impressive internship supervisor and mentor, your interns will probably talk about their experience with peers, friends and family members, essentially advertising for your organization.

# 14. Looking For Good Team Player? 

Very few major projects can be accomplished these days without teamwork. Fortunately, college/university student hires these days are thoroughly experienced in teamwork and cross-functional teams. Rather than being forced to participate, it comes natural to them.

# 15. They're Natural Multi-Taskers

They grew up in a multitasking world, so they look forward to being assigned to simultaneous tasks. Experienced hires might consider it overloading when you expect multiple tasks to be done simultaneously.

If you're an employer looking to get started on your student hiring, we have a solution for you. [Univjobs](https://univjobs.ca/employers) allows YOU to connect with students and recent grads from post-secondary institutions across Canada. It is an easier, more targeted way to find qualified student candidates.
