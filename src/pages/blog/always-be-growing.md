# Don't Be Afraid To Learn

I recently attended a lecture on the growth of programmatic and machine learning and the one thing that stood out from that lecture was when the speaker said, "85% of jobs that will exist in the future haven't been invented yet". I thought "WOW, I need to improve or I'm going to be left behind". Now with automation, it still amazes me that a machine can be programmed to learn and develop like a human.

I immediately signed up for a course course the next day offered through Digital Adlab (not getting paid or sponsored to say this), and I have say it definitely was a huge help (Shoutout to Ray Reid for simplifying the process). The end result was definitely worth it, as I recently went to one of those networking events and when someone brought up the same topic of programmatic, I was able to add to the conversation, that person ended up being a recruiter (who did end up offering me an opportunity).

## What I Learned

I will say that the one takeaway that would suggest is A.B.G (Always Be Growing) because the moment you stop growing, you start to lose passion for what you do.
