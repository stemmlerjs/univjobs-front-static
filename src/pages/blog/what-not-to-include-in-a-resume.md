  It’s almost that time of year again, where students and soon to be grads across Canada are polishing up their resumes in order to join the working world. The one aspect that often gets overlooked within this process is what to exclude from the resume. Thinking about this could be the difference between your resume getting the attention of a hiring manager vs getting overlooked, (as recruiters spend roughly 6 seconds on average looking at a single resume).
  Here are a few suggestions of what you should not include in a resume.

# 1. Avoid Longer Resumes

When writing your resume, remember that longer resumes usually get overlooked. The general consensus among HR experts is to keep your resume down to two pages, anything longer and you’re running the risk of getting passed over. 

If you cannot fit your resume onto two pages

**Try:**

To cut down your descriptions. Highlight more relevant tasks. Be clear and concise. It goes a long way.

_Formula (task-result-date)_

_“Designed a different approach to deliver food. Resulted to cutting delivery time from 30 minutes to 20 minutes.”_ 

**Instead of:**

Packing everything you’ve ever done at the job. If your resume requires effort to decipher what you did, sorry to say but, the resume will probably be passed over.


# 2. Using Attributes Without Results

Talking about yourself can be awkward, oftentimes you may stick to the cliche buzzwords, such as being a hard worker or out-of-the-box thinker. The question you need to ask yourself when using attributes is, “what have you done to be considered for those attributes”? 
If you say that you’re a fast-learner, try to include proof of that in your statements under your work experience. 

Employers want to see results. Whether it is a personal accomplishment (don’t get too personal, there is a line you don’t cross) or something within your academic/professional career to draw from. As long as you have quantifiable numbers to support those claims you’re already a step ahead of the other job seekers.     

**Try:**

_"Gathered and analyzed historical data from Google analytics. Based on analysis, presented new content suggestions to management.  This resulted in a 23% increase in traffic within the month of Nov 2018."_

**Instead of:**

_"Responsible for google analytics, content management and marketing initiatives."_


# 3. Spelling & Grammar Errors

This is an absolute resume killer. As mentioned earlier, recruiters look at hundreds of resumes daily and simple spelling and grammar mistakes can ensure that your resume gets passed over by employers.

Just remember to double check your resume for spelling and grammar mistakes, maybe even ask a friend to take a look.

# 4. Negative Words / Ideas

Avoid saying what you did not do or have not yet accomplished; focus instead on what you have done or are in the process of achieving. If you are still in college, list the year in which you will graduate. If you didn't graduate, simply list the dates you attended.

**Try:**  

_“September 2015 - April 2020 (Expected Graduation)_

_If you didn’t graduate or switched programs, write “September 2015”_

**Instead of:**

_"Not yet graduated or TBD"_


# 5. Unrelated Work Experience

When listing out your work experience. It is important to remember that an employer does not want your entire work history (again be clear and concise on the resume). List relevant positions that can be mapped to the job posting.

If you lack experience. Showcase your school/passion projects and volunteer experience instead that is within the industry you're applying to. This is what employers like to see and oftentimes a good technical skill set can be vital to landing that dream job.

If you are applying to a software development job;

**Try:**

_“On my spare time, created a Javascript application for a non-profit org. The application was used to help volunteers keep track of food inventory during delivery runs.”_

**Instead of:**

_Babysitting for 10 families within the local neighbourhood._
