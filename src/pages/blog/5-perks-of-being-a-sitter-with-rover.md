College is expensive, and between classes, extracurriculars, and social engagements, it can be difficult to find a gig that gives you flexible hours and allows you to pick and choose what you do.

Luckily, there’s a company out there that can help: Rover is the nation’s largest network of pet sitters and dog walkers, and the company is currently on the hunt for enthusiastic, dog-loving college students looking for a fun paid opportunity.

Why is Rover so great? Check out these five rockstar perks and you’ll be applying to become a Rover dog sitter in no time.

##1. You Set Your Price and Schedule
One of the best perks of being a dog sitter with Rover? You have the ability to set your price and schedule depending on your needs. So even if your availability is only on nights or weekends, you’ll still get to hang out with great dogs (and make some extra cash doing it).

Plus, those dog-walking and dog-sitting sessions add up quickly: Some Rover users (many of them college students!) have [made](https://www.rover.com/blog/sitter-resources/premium-insurance-info/?utm_source=wayup&utm_campaign=rover-sponsored-post-2&utm_medium=blog) well over $1,000 a month. So whether you’re paying tuition or student loans, or you just want a little extra cash for weekend fun, becoming a Rover dog sitter is a great option.

##2. You Pick Your Services
Whether it’s dog-sitting, dog walking, drop-in visits, or daycare, you get to choose which services you offer based on your schedule, your environment, and your comfort level. You’ll never get stuck doing something you don’t feel 100% prepared and excited to take on.

##3. You Get Premium Insurance
Rover offers [premium insurance](https://www.rover.com/guarantee/us/) to ensure that if any incidents occur, there’s a plan in place to help those who need it. For example, if a dog you’re walking becomes sick or gets in an altercation with your own pets, there’s extra peace of mind knowing that you’re covered.

##4. You’ll Have Help Promoting Your Rover Business
Rover understands that building a clientele is challenging, so the company offers [many ways](https://www.rover.com/blog/sitter-resources/promote-rover-business/?utm_source=univjobs&utm_campaign=rover-sponsored-post-2&utm_medium=blog) to help its sitters spread the word. Rover also spreads the word through its own channels.

Even better, Rover helps you earn cash for referring friends and family members to other sitters. If a pet owner uses your personal referral code to book any service through any sitter on Rover, you both win: The pet owner gets $20 off, and you earn $10. What’s not to love?

##5. You Can Give Part of Your Earnings to Help Dogs in Need
Chances are that if you’re a Rover sitter, you’re also a massive dog lover. Unfortunately, many dogs don’t get the love and care they deserve, but Rover is looking to change that.

To make a difference, the company offers an excellent perk to sitters: When you’re a dog sitter for Rover, you can allocate a percentage of your earnings to go to [dog-related charities](https://www.rover.com/partners/?utm_source=univjobs&utm_campaign=rover-sponsored-post-2&utm_medium=blog) like Dogs for the Deaf.

Sound like a company you can get behind? Rover is currently looking for dog sitters, so if you want playing with cute puppies to become part of your regular routine, you can apply for [Rover’s position on UnivJobs now](https://univjobs.ca/companies/rover/).
