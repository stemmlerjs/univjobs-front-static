When you’re in school, all everyone talks about is getting a job in Toronto, Vancouver or some other big city. 
But, no one ever talks about the everyday struggles that come with these jobs, whether that is
commuting a few hours or not being given the opportunities to learn and grow. With that in mind, 
here are 3 benefits of working locally.

# 3. Skip The Commute

Like I said earlier, commuting can be a pain and having to spend a couple hours each day 
going to and from a job takes a lot out of you. If you look for a position in your area, 
you’re essentially saving a ton of free time that can be used to sleep in or to enjoy the activities you love.   

# 2. Get a Headstart

With more employers asking for multiple years’ experience for entry level positions, 
getting a job that gives you an edge might be exactly what you need and since 
the job is convenient planning for your dream career is made that much easier.
  
#1 Growth Opportunities
           	
There are a growing number of Canadian cities still in their infancy, and if you’re in one of these areas, 
you will probably reap the benefits of the growth and jobs available with working locally.
 
It is important to get started early is really important as I said earlier.
