I am a woman in my early twenties soon to be graduating from the University of Toronto. You see, the past four years of my school life is not entirely reflected in my resume or my GPA. And why you will overlook someone like me. I will take you on a journey which each one of us has and you will decide if I am worth working for your company.

# The Beginning

I was born in a small town in the Northern part of Kenya and was raised by a teenage mother. Being the first born, I had to grow up quickly. Elementary school was for free lunches provided by the government of Kenya or else there was no meal at home. We slept on a mat on a cold ground, so each of our bones felt the unevenness of the earth. I mean there were no running water, “short” and “long businesses” were done in bushes. Electricity was non-existence so the lamp with kerosene did the magic for us to do our homework. And yet, I sometimes I do not feel am worth to be among the greatest minds. Slowly with the help of my psychiatrist, I have come to accept that I am worthy of being here. The universe conspired to bring me here for a reason and am not done. Well not without some falling and rising.

# Pressures of Life

You see in my resume, one of my work experiences is as a room attendant. A job I have been doing part-time in the past two years while studying. I scrub toilets, make beds, dust the room, restock complementary amenities are all part of being a room attendant. There is something more that comes with working a manual labour. You work hard, be a team player, you learn to be compassionate, kind and empathize with your fellow colleagues and clients. The job has able to support my family back home. Hussein (my brother), Sophia (my cousin), Bryson (my cousin), Roseline (my sister), Rosemary (my sister), Favor and Mevia ( my nephews) tuition are all paid in time. I cannot eat out as I would like or buy myself nice pair of shoes without thinking of my siblings. I would’ve have loved to have interned at Goldman Sachs, Google, Microsoft and all the fortune five hundred in one of my summer vacations if I just could’ve stopped myself from attempting suicide in my second year.

Unfortunately, my resume isn’t filled with the big names that hiring managers are looking for. Instead, I am left with passion, discipline, resiliency that cannot be seen in a piece of paper. After my attempted suicide, I had to take summer classes to compensate so I could graduate with my peers. A social pressure that we put in ourselves and our children. If only we could all understand that we are meant to have a different journey and to accept things as they come, maybe we can have a human to human interaction.

So, to all hiring managers, I am soon graduating from the University of Toronto and actively applying to jobs related to sales, marketing, finance, economics, product design and management.
