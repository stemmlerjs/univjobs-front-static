# Myth # 1

**Doing something without getting paid isn't worth it**

Reality It is actually a great way to gain experience

The number of entry level jobs requiring multiple years experience is growing, so even small things like helping a charity with social media or helping out with an event, can in fact be the perfect way to start you on your path to your dream job.



# Myth # 2

**I am going to be stuck doing this forever!**

Reality Starting doesn't necessarily mean committing

Since you are not bound down by getting paid (and all the legalities that come with that) for helping, you have the ability to explore your options, but volunteer positions do provide you with skills that you may not be able to get in an academic environment.



# Myth # 3

**I'm too busy to volunteer**

> Reality: There is no Perfect Time. In the words of Shia LaBeouf, Just Do It!

Volunteering is not just about helping others, it also allows you to better yourself. So the question becomes can you make the time to better yourself?
