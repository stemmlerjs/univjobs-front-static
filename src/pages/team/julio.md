Quite simply, Julio loves automation and has helped numerous companies streamline their IT infrastructure.

As an Infrastructure Developer, his passion is automating infrastructure, however, he consistently demonstrates his willingness to pitch in anywhere necessary to ensure other team members can remain focused on helping students and employers.

To say that Julio is multi-cultural is an understatement. Julio was born in Cuba, raised in China and speaks 3 languages fluently (Mandarin, Spanish and English). He is a phenomenon in more ways than one to be sure!
